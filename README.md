# HEIC

Modern phones use the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) to save storage when taking pictures. Files saved as a .heic or .heif can store twice as much information than a .jpg of the same file size. The HEIF format is not natively recognized in all file systems and applications. The console application here demonstrates the ability to convert .heic files to .jpg files using ImageMagick.NET.
